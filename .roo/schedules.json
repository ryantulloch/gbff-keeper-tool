      "taskInstructions": "Automated Overnight Pipeline Performance Testing Protocol for Roo\n\nYour objective is to autonomously conduct a series of performance tests on the batch indexing pipeline, document the results, and prepare for subsequent test cycles. You must complete all steps without asking Ryan any questions. If you encounter an unrecoverable error not explicitly handled by these instructions, log the error in detail to the main performance log file and then terminate your current task cycle; the next Roo instance will pick up from there.\n\nCore Test Details:\n\nThe script under test is scripts/batch-indexing/index.ts. The fixed input file for all tests is \"E:\\Docs to Process\\Separation Agreements\\Interspousal Agreement - (Mackow Precedent).docx\". All tests will run in template mode with a logLevel of info. The script reads configuration parameters from the .env file, including METADATA_BATCH_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT (MBCL), METADATA_API_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT (MACL), CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S1_CORE (S1), CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S2_LISTS (S2), CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S3_CLAUSE_LOGIC (S3), and CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S4_TEMPLATE_VARS (S4). The base command to execute is: npx tsx scripts/batch-indexing/index.ts --inputFile \"E:\\Docs to Process\\Separation Agreements\\Interspousal Agreement - (Mackow Precedent).docx\" --mode template --logLevel info.\n\nParameter Testing Sequence:\nYou will cycle through the following combinations for (MBCL, MACL, S1, S2, S3, S4). After the last set of parameters, the testing cycle is complete. If all listed combinations have been tested and documented, you must generate new, reasonable combinations to test based on the observed performance trends.\n\n(MBCL=4, MACL=6, S1=5, S2=5, S3=3, S4=5)\n(MBCL=4, MACL=6, S1=7, S2=7, S3=3, S4=7)\n(MBCL=4, MACL=6, S1=5, S2=5, S3=5, S4=5)\n(MBCL=5, MACL=8, S1=5, S2=5, S3=3, S4=5)\n(MBCL=5, MACL=8, S1=7, S2=7, S3=5, S4=7)\n(MBCL=3, MACL=4, S1=5, S2=5, S3=3, S4=5)\n(MBCL=6, MACL=8, S1=10, S2=10, S3=5, S4=10)\n(MBCL=4, MACL=4, S1=5, S2=5, S3=3, S4=5)\n(MBCL=4, MACL=8, S1=5, S2=5, S3=3, S4=5)\n(MBCL=5, MACL=6, S1=5, S2=5, S3=3, S4=5)\n(MBCL=4, MACL=6, S1=8, S2=8, S3=4, S4=8)\n(MBCL=5, MACL=7, S1=6, S2=6, S3=4, S4=6)\n(MBCL=3, MACL=5, S1=7, S2=7, S3=3, S4=7)\n(MBCL=6, MACL=7, S1=9, S2=9, S3=5, S4=9)\n(MBCL=4, MACL=5, S1=6, S2=6, S3=4, S4=6)\n\nWorkflow Steps:\n\nFirst, you must analyze the results of the previous test run. To do this, begin by identifying the correct log file. Look in the logs/ directory to find the batchIndex_*.json file with the most recent timestamp that occurred before your current execution started. Read this target log file. From the log's content, determine the start and end timestamps to calculate the total execution time. Note any Zod validation errors or other critical errors reported in the log. If the log indicates the script did not finish (e.g., it ends abruptly or with unhandled errors), record the status as \"Failed\" or \"Incomplete.\" Read the current .env file to determine the METADATA_BATCH_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT, METADATA_API_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT, CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S1_CORE, CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S2_LISTS, CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S3_CLAUSE_LOGIC, and CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S4_TEMPLATE_VARS settings that were active for that completed run (these are the settings that were in the .env file when the previous Roo instance launched the run you are now analyzing).\n\nSecond, you will document the results of the analyzed test run. Read the existing performance log file at docs/pipeline-benchmarks/2025-05-07-1820-batch-indexing-performance-log.md. Then add a new entry for the test run you just analyzed. This entry should be formatted with a heading including the date and key parameters (e.g., \"## Test Run: YYYY-MM-DD (MBCL=X, MACL=Y, S1=A, S2=B, S3=C, S4=D)\") followed by bullet points detailing: Document Tested (fixed), Execution Time (or \"Failed\"/\"Incomplete\"), Status (Successful/Failed), Mode (fixed), Metadata Batch Concurrency (from .env of previous run), API Concurrency Limit (Metadata specific, from .env of previous run), Stage 1 Batch Size (from .env of previous run), Stage 2 Batch Size (from .env of previous run), Stage 3 Batch Size (from .env of previous run), Stage 4 Batch Size (from .env of previous run), Model (fixed as gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25), Input File Path (fixed), and any notable errors or observations under \"Other Notes.\" Ensure this new entry is added chronologically or as the latest entry. YOU MUST ALWAYS USE THE gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 MODEL - UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN ANY OTHER MODEL BE USED. THIS IS A PARAMOUNT RULE.\n\nThird, you must commit the results. Run the following git commands sequentially: git add docs/pipeline-benchmarks/2025-05-07-1820-batch-indexing-performance-log.md .env. Then, git commit -m \"Automated Test: Log results for MBCL={prev_MBCL}, MACL={prev_MACL}, S1={prev_S1}, S2={prev_S2}, S3={prev_S3}, S4={prev_S4}. Time: {exec_time_or_status}\" (replacing placeholders with actual values from the analyzed run).\n\nFourth, you need to prepare for the next test run. Consult the \"Parameter Testing Sequence\" above. Determine the next set of (MBCL, MACL, S1, S2, S3, S4) parameters that has not yet been documented in the docs/pipeline-benchmarks/2025-05-07-1820-batch-indexing-performance-log.md file. If all parameter sets have been tested and documented, then come up with new settings to test based on analysis of the logged results. Read the current .env file. Then update the METADATA_BATCH_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT, METADATA_API_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT, CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S1_CORE, CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S2_LISTS, CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S3_CLAUSE_LOGIC, and CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE_P2_S4_TEMPLATE_VARS lines in the .env file to match these new parameters for the upcoming test.\n\nFifth, commit the .env change. Run: git add .env then git commit -m \"Automated Test: Update .env for next run (MBCL={new_MBCL}, MACL={new_MACL}, S1={new_S1}, S2={new_S2}, S3={new_S3}, S4={new_S4})\". You do not need to push this specific commit yet; the push will happen after the next run's results are logged.\n\nSixth, launch the new test run. Run this command: npx tsx scripts/batch-indexing/index.ts --inputFile \"E:\\Docs to Process\\Separation Agreements\\Interspousal Agreement - (Mackow Precedent).docx\" --mode template --logLevel info. This command will run with the new settings you've just applied to the .env file. You do not need to monitor its completion; the next scheduled Roo instance will handle its analysis - just like how you will at the start of this task. It's a fully autonomous testing loop for Ryan!\n\nSeventh, push the changes. Run: git push. This pushes both the updated performance log (from step 3) and the .env file (from step 5).\n\nRemember, complete autonomy is critical. Do not ask for clarifications. Follow these instructions precisely. You will never ask Ryan for input or a question - it is fully autonomous.\n\n**Critical Prerequisite: Correct Tool Usage**\n\nRoo, before you begin any steps in this protocol, it is absolutely essential that you understand and correctly apply the XML formatting for all tool usage. Every tool call must start with the tool's name in opening and closing tags (e.g., `&lt;read_file&gt;...&lt;/read_file&gt;`). Within these main tags, *every parameter* the tool requires must also be enclosed in its own specific opening and closing tags.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   **Correct `read_file` usage:**\n    ```xml\n    <read_file>\n      <path>your/actual/file/path.ext</path>\n    </read_file>\n    ```\n\n*   **Correct `insert_content` usage (example):**\n    ```xml\n    <insert_content>\n      <path>docs/your_log_file.md</path>\n      <line>10</line>\n      <content>\n    This is the content to insert.\n    It can be multiple lines.\n      </content>\n    </insert_content>\n    ```\n\n*   **Correct `execute_command` usage (example):**\n    ```xml\n    <execute_command>\n      <command>git status</command>\n    </execute_command>\n    ```\n\nFailure to adhere strictly to this XML formatting for *all* parameters of *all* tools will result in errors and prevent the successful completion of this automated protocol. Double-check every tool call.\n",

      "taskInstructions": "Automated UI Refinement & Testing Protocol for Roo (Project Ratio Terminal Output)\n\nObjective:\nYour primary objective is to autonomously iterate on the scripts/batch-indexing/index.ts script to achieve a specific, desired terminal UI output state. You will analyze previous test runs, identify discrepancies from the target UI, formulate and apply code fixes, run new tests, and meticulously document each iteration. You must complete all steps without asking Ryan any questions. If you encounter an unrecoverable error not explicitly handled by these instructions, log the error in detail to the main UI iteration report file and then terminate your current task cycle; the next Roo instance will pick up from there.\n\nCore Test Details:\nScript Under Test: scripts/batch-indexing/index.ts\nFixed Input File: \"E:\\ryan-resources\\Testing Docs\\Interspousal Agreement - Mock Precedent.docx\" (or the one Ryan is currently using for UI debugging, ensure this is consistent).\nTest Mode: Always use --mode TEMPLATE.\nDisplay Mode: Primarily use --display compact for visual verification against the target. Use --display verbose only if explicitly needed for deep debugging of a specific issue you are trying to fix, and switch back to compact for the main test run that generates the output for analysis.\nLog Level: Use --logLevel info for compact runs. For verbose debugging runs, debug is appropriate.\nTarget UI State: The desired terminal output is as per the detailed summary provided by the AI Assistant (your current prompter), which includes:\n  - Live, incremental, concurrent updates for Stage S1-S4 bars (showing X/N_chunks and \"Last API Call: Z chunks OK/FAIL\").\n  - \"Phase 2: Metadata Ext.\" bar updating X/4 based on successful completion of S1-S4.\n  - All other phase bars (Docling, P0, P1, Embedding, Indexing, P3) showing an initial \"In Progress\" state then a final \"✓ Done\" (or \"✗ Failed\") state with total items and speed/duration.\n  - Correct speed calculations for all completed operations.\n  - All bars remaining visible above a clean final summary (Batch Processing Complete, Detailed Durations).\n  - No visual glitches, no duplicate bars, correct alignment.\n\nWorkflow Steps:\n\nStep 1: Analyze Previous Iteration & Current Code State\n  Read Previous UI Iteration Report:\n    - Locate and read the latest UI iteration report file: docs/ui-iterations/ratio-batch-indexing-ui-log.md.\n    - Understand the changes made by the previous Roo instance, the observed output (screenshots/descriptions), and the discrepancies it identified.\n    - Note the Git commit hash associated with the previous iteration if available in the report.\n  \n  Review Current Code State:\n    - Ensure your workspace is updated to the latest commit from the main branch (or the relevant development branch Ryan specifies). git pull\n    - Familiarize yourself with the current state of key files involved in progress display, primarily:\n      * scripts/batch-indexing/batch-processor/processors/metadata-processor.ts\n      * scripts/batch-indexing/batch-processor/processors/batchExtractionUtils.ts\n      * scripts/batch-indexing/batch-processor/core/progress-system/ProgressOrchestrator.ts\n      * scripts/batch-indexing/batch-processor/core/progress-system/BarManager.ts\n      * scripts/batch-indexing/batch-processor/core/progress-system/DisplayController.ts\n      * Relevant configuration files (e.g., .env for batch sizes, though these should be stable unless a specific test requires changing them).\n\nStep 2: Identify Discrepancies & Formulate Fixes\n  Compare Observed vs. Desired: Based on the previous report and your understanding of the target UI state, identify the most critical discrepancies in the current terminal output.\n  \n  Hypothesize Cause & Plan Solution:\n    - For each discrepancy, form a hypothesis about the root cause in the code.\n    - Develop a clear, step-by-step plan to modify the code to address the issue. Prioritize direct fixes over workarounds.\n    - The AI Assistant (your prompter) will provide detailed analysis and instructions for these fixes. You (Roo) must implement these instructions precisely.\n\nStep 3: Implement Code Changes\n  Apply Fixes: Instruct your VS Code agent to make the necessary code modifications as per the plan from Step 2 (guided by the AI Assistant).\n  Lint & Type Check: After applying changes, run biome check . --fix && tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json. Resolve any errors. (NO npx - TypeScript and Biome are globally installed)\n\nStep 4: Conduct a New Test Run\n  Execute the Script: Run the batch indexing script with the standard test parameters:\n    npx tsx scripts/batch-indexing/index.ts --inputFile \"E:\\ryan-resources\\Testing Docs\\Interspousal Agreement - Mock Precedent.docx\" --mode TEMPLATE --display compact --logLevel info\n    (If you needed to use --display verbose for a specific debugging step before this, ensure you switch back to compact for this main test run).\n  \n  Capture Output:\n    - Crucial: Capture the entire terminal output from the start of the command to its completion. This includes all progress bars at various stages and the final summary. If possible, take screenshots at key moments (e.g., mid-Phase 2, final screen). If direct screenshot capability is not available, ensure the textual capture is complete and accurate.\n    - Note the start and end timestamps of this test run.\n\nStep 5: Document Current Iteration & Write Report for Ryan\n  Analyze New Output: Carefully examine the captured terminal output from Step 4.\n    - Compare it against the desired UI state.\n    - Note which previous discrepancies are now fixed.\n    - Identify any new discrepancies or regressions.\n    - Note any errors reported in the console or in the logs/batchIndex_*.json file for this run.\n  \n  Write/Update UI Iteration Report:\n    - Open/create docs/ui-iterations/ratio-batch-indexing-ui-log.md.\n    - Add a new entry for the iteration you just completed. Format it clearly:\n\n    ## UI Iteration: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (Your Roo Instance ID/Timestamp)\n\n    **Previous State / Discrepancies Addressed (from last report):**\n    * [Summary of issues tackled in this iteration]\n\n    **Changes Implemented in This Iteration:**\n    * [Brief description of code change 1, e.g., \"Modified `metadata-processor.ts` to correctly increment 'Phase 2: Metadata Ext.' bar.\"]\n    * [Link to relevant commit if changes are committed before report generation, or describe files changed.]\n\n    **Observed Output & Analysis (from test run in Step 4):**\n    * **Overall Impression:** [e.g., \"Significant improvement in S1-S4 updates, Phase 2 bar now incremental.\"]\n    * **Screenshots/Terminal Output Snippets:** (If you can embed or link, do so. Otherwise, describe key visual states.)\n      ```text\n      [Paste relevant terminal output snippets here, especially showing the state of progress bars]\n      ```\n    * **Fixed Discrepancies:**\n      [List issues from previous report that are now resolved]\n    * **Remaining/New Discrepancies:**\n      [List issues still present or newly introduced, compared to the target UI state]\n    * **Errors Encountered (if any):** [Detail any script errors from console or JSON log]\n    * **Execution Time:** [Calculated duration of the test run]\n\n    **Plan for Next Iteration (Hypotheses & Proposed Fixes for Remaining Discrepancies):**\n    [Based on your analysis, what's the next most important UI issue to fix?]\n    [Briefly, what's your initial thought on how to fix it? The AI Assistant will elaborate.]\n\n    **Detailed Summary Report for Ryan:**\n    * **Progress Towards Target UI:** [Provide a concise summary of how much closer this iteration got to the perfect UI. Highlight key positive changes.]\n    * **Key Issues Remaining:** [Clearly list the 1-3 most important UI bugs/discrepancies that still need to be addressed.]\n    * **Blockers/Concerns (if any):** [Any technical challenges or areas where progress is unexpectedly slow?]\n    * **Focus for Next Roo Instance:** [What should the next Roo instance prioritize based on this report?]\n\nStep 6: Commit Report & Code Changes\n  Add Files: git add docs/ui-iterations/ratio-batch-indexing-ui-log.md\n            git add . (to stage all code changes made in Step 3)\n  Commit:\n    git commit -m \"UI Iteration: [Detailed summary of fixes applied, e.g., 'Fix Phase 2 bar, refine S3 speed']. Report updated.\"\n\nStep 7: Push Changes\n  Run: git push\n  This pushes the updated UI iteration report and all code modifications.",
